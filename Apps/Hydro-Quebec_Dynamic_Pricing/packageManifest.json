    "releaseNotes": "1.0.2 - 2025-01-30 \n     - Added Triggers, aka switches that turn on during an event to fire other automations.\n     - Corrected a bug when first installed and calling a polling method that is no longer available. \n     - Commented out voice message options as I could not test this anymore, will be back soon as soon as I reinstall my SONOS speaker. \n     - Corrected the way pre-events change into events to prevent having some things not return to normal at the end of it all",
