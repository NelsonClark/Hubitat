# vThermostat

vThermostat is a Hubitat App / Device Driver that will let you use 1 or multiple temperature sensors to control an outlet/plug that is used to turn on or off a heater and/or air conditioner.

It is based on vThermostat by Josh208 (https://github.com/josh208/hubitat/tree/master/vThermostat) that seems to be MIA from the Hubitat community.
